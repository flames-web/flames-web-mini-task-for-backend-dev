Mini-task for the backend developer position
Instruction
Build an API for a simple e-commerce like website
Features
Authentication: 
Signup
Login
Email Confirmation OTP
Password Reset
View a Hompage with generated items for listing
Add some listed Items to a cart
Go to cart and checkout order 

You don’t need to use any payment gateway, just simulate an endpoint to call that will simulate making a payment. E.g A post request to the endpoint xyz.com/pay will return a response message of ‘You have successfully made a payment’

I should be able to use an order ID to view the content of the order from an admin endpoint
The Goal
We want you to attempt solving this challenge using MongoDB  & NodeJS

Submission
Send a link to a google doc file to  containing the following: 
Endpoints 
A brief documentation 
This way we will be able to interact and test your API

Thank you very much for attempting to solve this challenge.
Best of luck
